Arch-blueissue -- an alternate /etc/issue-file for Arch Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


README


(1) As root, back up your original /etc/issue first.
(2) Copy the file "issue" to /etc/issue to have a cool login-screen for your virtual consoles, containing a multi-colored blue-white Arch Linux logo, a (German) slogan, kernel version, date and time, numbers of logged in users, actual vc, and your $HOST, respectively.


The contents is optimized (centered) for a resolution at 1024x768px. Look here for a screenshot:

For other resolutions simply add oder delete the preceding and in-between spaces.

The German slogan means "Arch Linux, a simple and lightweight Linux distribution". Just edit it to your liking.

For other colors, you will have to change the color codes. They must be initiated with the escaped (non-printing) character combination "<Esc>[" (in vim), especially highlighted and displayed as "^["; this is what e. g. "\[" means for bash. -- For a list of possible foreground and background colors see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_Bash_Prompt#List_of_colors_for_prompt_and_Bash.


Note: To explicitely clear the screen after booting, e. g. for the bootloader Syslinux add "MENU CLEAR" to "/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg".


Have fun!
